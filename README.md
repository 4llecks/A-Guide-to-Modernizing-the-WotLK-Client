# A Guide to Modernizing the Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a) Client

**Hello there!** My name is _**Marotheit**_, and I wanted to share a guide on modernizing your World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a) client installation for private servers. This guide encompasses a lot of information I found spread out amongst the World of Warcraft forumverse, assembled in one location for my friends, family, and fellow nerds.

In this guide, I will discuss the basics of client-side patches, provide sources (and mirrors) to popular patches, cover some additional visual settings, and end with some additonal steps. Let us begin.

> ### Note: This guide has not been endorsed or approved by any particular private servers or their moderation teams. You may encounter technical issues, game crashes, or even banishment. I _personally_ have not had any issues, but do continue at your own risk.

## Client-Side Patches:

Client-Side Patches are pre-compiled data packages for World of Warcraft that are initialized upon launching the game. Patches often contain enhancements for the game in the form of improved textures, updated models, and various interface changes (like custom loading screens or music). These patches are shared in `.MPQ` format and stored in the `World of Warcraft\Data` folder.

The best place to find patches you may be interested in includes the [Model Changing Network](https://model-changing.net/), the now defunct [Modcraft.io](https://web.archive.org/web/20210123222835/www.modcraft.io/index.php) through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20210123222835/www.modcraft.io/index.php), and various private server forums around the internet.

Applying certain patches may have an impact on your client's performance, so be wary of your framerate. In addition, running many patches has been known to max out the 2GB of available memory the Wrath of the Lich King client has access to, leading to random game crashes. You can fix this problem by using [Large Address Aware](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/large-address-aware.112556/) (if you have enough memory) to allow the client access up to 4GB of available memory.

It is important to mention that because of the way many files are shared between different systems in the game, some patches may have unforeseen issues and not all patches are compatible with one another, so you must be careful about which ones you decide to add to your installation. As a general rule of thumb, patches that both effect the same item(s) (such as lighting, animations, models, textures, music, etc.) may not be compatible with one another.

## Installing Client-Side Patches:
After you have downloaded all components of a patch and ensured the game is fully closed, unzip all folders until you see `patch-X.MPQ`. All patches should be placed in `World of Warcraft\Data`, relative to your Wrath of the Lich King client location. If you have two patches with the same name, rename the number or letter following `patch-` to an available number or letter.

You should _**never**_ overwrite the original patches provided to you during the initial setup process (this being `common.MPQ`, `common-2.MPQ`, `expansion.MPQ`, `lichking.MPQ`, `patch.MPQ`, `patch-2.MPQ`, or `patch-3.MPQ`), otherwise your installation will cease to work.

Patches are initialized in numerical, then alphabetical order. In rare instances, some patches must load before others to ensure compatibility. You can find the initialization order I use for the below patches [here](https://github.com/Marotheit/A-Guide-to-Modernizing-the-WotLK-Client/blob/main/PatchInitializationOrder.md).

If you wish to uninstall a patch, simply delete it from the `World of Warcraft\Data` folder.

## Patch Recommendations:
Below is a list of popular client-side patches for Wrath of the Lich King, game version 3.3.5a. The intent of most of these patches is to enhance your Wrath of the Lich King installation with assets from newer World of Warcraft releases.

While each source *should* contain the most up-to-date version of any given patch, the original threads are sometimes removed with no prior warning by their hosts, and have been mirrored here for ease-of-access and archival purposes. I did my best to include before and after examples for many of the patches, when applicable.

I've experimented with many of the popular water mods out there and compiled the assets I liked most from all of them. [[Before/After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26125775/147507984-625a77c0-867b-40be-9a35-c83ebc7880ca.png)]
- [Increased View Distance](https://mega.nz/#!m05CRLaT!hQK95Qt0fFdbfhc9UT-AjgvNeud_s3OTvE-l2WJ5X60) by [Nikk0z](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-emulator-servers/wow-emu-programs/617938-vanilla-1-12-1-tbc-2-4-3-wotlk-3-3-5a-view-distance-unlock-patched-wow-exe.html) increases the maximum value for the /farclip command, which sets the view distance. Original max values are 777 for Vanilla, 783.33 for TBC and 1583.33 for WotLK. 

## Visual Settings
Beyond basic graphical settings (i.e., the standard graphical presets) there are console commands you can run in-game to increase graphical variables higher than Blizzard allowed through the in-game video settings menu. On that note, you should probably only perform these commands on a higher-end PC. Running the following commands will result in extra details around the world becoming more noticeable.

You should finalize your video settings _**before**_ attempting to use these macros, as modifying any graphical options through the video settings menu will reset all graphical variables to their default values. Similarly, if you try the below console commands and do not enjoy the extra graphical fidelity, simply change your graphical preset in the video settings menu to reset all graphical variables to default. You can use the [console variables wiki page](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Console_variables) to see what each command changes individually.

The commands below have been seperated into three easy to use macros for your convenience, but can be performed individually if you prefer.

Ultra+ Graphics 1:
```
/console environmentDetail 150
/console farclip 777
/console ffxnetherworld 1
/console ffxspecial 1
/console groundEffectDensity 192
/console groundEffectDist 140
/console groundEffectFade 1000
/console gxmultiesample 8
/console horizonFarclipScale 6
```

Ultra+ Graphics 2:
```

/console shadowmode 3
/console shadowtexturesize 2048
/console skycloudlod 3
/console spellEffectLevel 200
/console ssao 2
/console terrainMipLevel 0
/console textureFilteringMode 5
```

Ultra+ Graphics 3:
```
/console violencelevel 5
/console waterDetail 3
/console weatherDensity 3
```

## ReShade
[ReShade](https://reshade.me/) is a post-processing injector that can add ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, color correction, film grain, depth of field effects, and more visual effects to games that do not normally include this functionality. This can provide graphical improvements that would normally be impossible using an unmodified World of Warcraft client.

> Through testing, I have discovered the Wrath of the Lich King client is only compatible with ReShade versions 4.9.1 and below. If someone is able to get the latest version of ReShade working with the client, feel free to message me and I'll update the guide to the latest version.

To install and configure ReShade, follow the step below.

>1.) Download [ReShade v4.9.1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/32o5pwxibc8m7rz/ReShade_Setup_v4.9.1.zip), and extract the zip to a location of your choosing.
>
>2.) Launch the downloaded ReShade Setup executable.
>
>3.) Click the 'Click here to select a game and manage its ReShade installation' button and navigate to (and select) the World of Warcraft executable.
>
>4.) Select 'Direct3D 9' as the rendering API.
>
>5.) You will be prompted to select the effects packages you wish to install. I recommend the default options (the full 'Standard effects' installation and the full 'SweetFX' installation). Click the 'OK' button when you have completed this step.
>
>6.) At this point, assuming the installation was successful, you may exit the ReShade Setup window.

Upon opening the World of Warcraft client, you will see a ReShade toast at the top of the screen, prompting you to press the `Home` key to begin the ReShade tutorial. Any changes are reflected in real time, so find a scenic spot in the world and adjust settings to what looks best for you.

## Extra Steps
At this point, your graphics should appear more in line with modern version of World of Warcraft. Below are a few extra steps you can use to take your installation even further.

### Using a Batch File to Clear Your Cache Before Startup
You can use a batch file to clear your cached files before you launch World of Warcraft. This is a good way to avoid common issues from appearing in-game. Simply download [this batch file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/u2zcm0y5clhis1q/Clear_Cache_Batch.zip) (or create a batch file with the text below) and place it into your Wrath of the Lich King client install location. You should launch the game using this batch file from now on.
```
@echo off
rd /s /q "Cache"
start WoW.exe
exit
```

### Push Your Graphical/Performance Configuration Further
You can set some graphical and performance settings even higher by editing your configuration file. Navigate to `World of Warcraft\WTF` and open `Config.wtf` in a notepad. Add the lines below to push your World of Warcraft settings even further.
```
SET M2Faster "3"
SET gxTextureCacheSize "512"
SET objectFade "0"
SET screenshotQuality "10"
```

Additionally, you can overwrite the lines below to enable Windowed Fullscreen, which many players are unable to enable successfully from within the client.
```
SET gxWindow "1"
SET gxMaximize "1"
SET windowResizeLock "1"
```

After your done, save the configuration file and open World of Warcraft to observe your changes. If the game has issues loading, you can simply delete `Config.wtf` (which will reset all your saved options) and try again.

### Install [VoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover/releases)
This adds text-to-speech support for gossip and quest texts. Be sure you install both the 3.3.5a `Voiceover` AddOn and the `Vanilla Sounds` pack into your `AddOns` folder.

### Install [Discord Rich Presence for World of Warcraft](https://github.com/wodim/wow-discord-rich-presence)
This enables World of Warcraft (with the help of Python) to interact with Discord Rich Presence to display gameplay information beside your user profile. Useful for guilds and friend circles who use Discord.

### Install [ElvUI-Glues-WotLK](https://github.com/Marotheit/ElvUI-Glues-WotLK)
This retextures the login, character selection, and character creation screens for use with ElvUI. This is included in the [ElvUI version of LoginTweaks](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bopbpw319m42uit/ElvUI-LoginTweaks.zip), so feel free to skip this step if you decide to use [LoginTweaks](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bopbpw319m42uit/ElvUI-LoginTweaks.zip).
