(01.07.2023)  
- Grammatical and layout changes.
- Added vvladoon's reworked spell animations patch which should be _**used with caution.**_
- Modified references of many patches to instead point to vvladoon's patches, since they are often more thorough and up-to-date.
- Added mirrors for all patches, since the original threads are sometimes removed with no prior warning.
